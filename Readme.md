# On-Chain Polls - Basic Staking Platform

## 1. Project Title
**On-Chain Polls: Basic Staking Platform**

## 2. Project Description
The Basic Staking Platform is a minimal Clarity smart contract that enables users to stake and unstake STX tokens directly on the Stacks blockchain. It maintains a record of each user's stake and the total amount staked in the contract.

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to provide a lightweight, transparent, and decentralized staking solution that can serve as the foundational layer for more complex systems such as governance platforms, reward distribution mechanisms, or voting-based applications.

## 4. Future Scope
- **Reward Distribution**: Implement automated reward payouts based on stake duration.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Integrate staking with an on-chain polling/voting system.
- **Lock Periods**: Add optional lock-up durations for higher rewards.
- **Multi-token Support**: Extend to support staking of fungible tokens beyond STX.
